-------------------
Softwares required
-------------------
1. Anaconda package (Jupyter Notebook)
2. Pycharm
3. Xampp
4. Notepad ++

--------------------------
Method to use the software
--------------------------
1. Run "project_api.py" and "home_prediction.py" in pycharm
2. open xampp and run Apache and MySQL
3. open localhost in browser and access the "home.php" page.

---------------------------
Front End folder:
----------------------------

1. It has the front end HTML and PHP code. 
2. Home.php is the first page
3. Home_prediction page- You can access the prediction directly from the home page.
4. To access the software First signup as the user and create username and password.
    Login as the user.
5. Fill in all the details of the patients and access the parameters page while has the predictions.

6. "difficulties_in_airway.sql" is the database file. You have open the xampp and import this file to get the database.


You have to CONNECT TO INTERNET while using the front end.(some styling files are online)



-----------------------------
Connection Model to Html
----------------------------

This folder contains the backend code

1.Download pycharm

2. Run the "project_api.py" and "home_prediction.py". You have to do this before accesing the prediction page in the front end

3. In "Ml model in flask(1).py"  the Machine learning model for Mask ventiation is trained and stored in a file name mask_ventil.pkl

4. Im "mlIntub model.py" the Intubation model is trained and stored in a file named "intubation.pkl" 

you DONT need to run "Ml model in flask(1).py" and "mlIntub model.py" for running the software

----------------------------
Experiments in Jupyter Notebook
------------------------------
1. "Mask Ventilation.csv" is the Mask ventilation dataset

2. "Mask ventilation dataset_formatted.csv" is the formatted dataset. In this the values are converted into interger format. For experimentation this file can be directly used as dataset. 

3. "Mask ventilation data processing and model creation.ipynb" has the entire code. 
	In the begining the libraries are loaded.
	The values of dataset are converted into integer format
	Graphs are plotted
	Machine learning algorithms are employed

4. In "Experiments for entire dataset.ipynb" the formatted dataset is used for experimentation.
